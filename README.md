# groupPygame
semester 2 group project using pygame


# using launch.bat
launch.bat currently looks like this  
- M:\python_pygame\python M:\groupPygame\main.py

This assumes you extracted the .Zip file from blackboard to your M:\ drive  
and your local repo is in a folder called groupPygame also on your M:\ drive.

if this is not the case you should edit the file paths so they match your system.
